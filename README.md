# Introduction
In this deep learning project, we will learn how to recognize the human faces in live video with Python. We will build this project using python dlibâ€™s facial recognition network. Dlib is a general-purpose software library. Using dlib toolkit, we can make real-world machine learning applications.
# Project Prerequisites:
You need to install the dlib library and face_recognition API from PyPI:
- pip3 install dlib 
- pip3 install face_recognition
# Problem Statement
# Requirements :
Jupyter Notebook
# Importing the Libraries :
- sys
- cv2
- face_recognnition
- pickcle

# CONCLUSION
This deep learning project teaches you how to develop a human face recognition project with python libraries dlib and face_recognition APIs (of OpenCV).

It also covers the introduction to face_recognition API. We have implemented this python project in two parts:

In the first part, we have seen how to store the information about human face structure, i.e face embedding. Then we learn how to store these embeddings.
In the second part, we have seen how to recognize the person by comparing the new face embeddings with the stored one.
