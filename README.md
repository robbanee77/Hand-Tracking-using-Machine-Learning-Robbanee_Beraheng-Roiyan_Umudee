# CONCLUSION
This deep learning project teaches you how to develop a human face recognition project with python libraries dlib and face_recognition APIs (of OpenCV).

It also covers the introduction to face_recognition API. We have implemented this python project in two parts:

In the first part, we have seen how to store the information about human face structure, i.e face embedding. Then we learn how to store these embeddings.
In the second part, we have seen how to recognize the person by comparing the new face embeddings with the stored one.
